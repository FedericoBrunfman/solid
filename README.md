Backend REST API for a simple note-taking app.

Application Features:
* Users can add, delete and modify their notes
* Users can see a list of all their notes
* Users must be logged in, in order to view/add/delete/etc. their notes
* User management API to create new users

Optional features
* Users can filter their notes via tags
* Tags can be public or private for each user (up to you)
* Search contents of their notes with keywords
* Token based authentication using third party package
* Write test accordingly (recommended trying the TDD approach as you go, instead of starting with Postman or insomnia)

Suggestions:
* You can either use SQLite3 or PostgreSQL as a database
* Please include a database migration file
* You can use virtualenv, simpler than a docker environment
* Write down all dependencies on a requirements.txt file
* If you find something that you would like to work on next, please write it down as TODO on the readme or any other Python file.
